                I see this as a way of archiving of some older works as well as a platform for showing newer works.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                On a personal note the site can allow me to test works in progress, removing them from the safety of the studio and as a means of exposing them to a wider audience.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                A few of the works have found new homes whilst the majority are either tucked away in storage, occasionally liberated for display in my house to be lived with.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                If anyone is interested in owning any of my work please contact me through the contact form on here.
