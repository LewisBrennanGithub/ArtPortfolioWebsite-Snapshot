                <br/>

<p>
I was born in Edinburgh in 1956.
<br/>
<br/>
As a child I drew constantly and made stuff,  homemade cardboard models, plastic kits, Bala wood aircraft, wooden boats, model houses etc, I created my own worlds in my own way.
Art at school was disappointing, or maybe it was just school that was stifling, I could not get out soon enough.
<br/>
<br/>
In 1972 I embarked on a seven year apprenticeship at the Edinburgh Tapestry Company, I learned about how paintings were made in order to translate them into weaving. 
The more I got involved I realised I had to move on, my curiosity about what art might be was heightened after coming in to contact with great artists whose work we translated.
<br/>
<br/>
My early exit from school meant I had to take qualifications in order to apply to Edinburgh College of Art and I had been attending evening classes for drawing to build a portfolio.
I spent five years at college, mainly working in mixed media and construction. After leaving college I had lots of odd jobs while trying to make art.
<br/>
<br/>
After a few years I was able to take on part time teaching jobs at Edinburgh College of Art and Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and was a visiting lecturer in other Art Schools in Scotland.
I eventually became a full time lecturer at Edinburgh in the School of Drawing and Painting. After thirty five years working with great students and colleagues and as head of Painting I retired in 2020.

<p>
Throughout all this time my work varied between mixed media, sculpture, drawing, printmaking and laterally concentrating on painting.
<br/>
<br/>
My paintings have evolved from paintings of objects, painted objects and through to more recent works loosely based on experiences of landscape and place.
<br/>
<br/>
I inherited my Father's sign writers enamel paints and brushes and have tried to work with them and against them, maybe I could make it easier on myself working with more standard painting mediums but I enjoy the challenge and somehow these materials connect me to the artisanal sensibilities of my father and wider family.
<br/>
<br/>
I work in sequences and collections, I have a strong interest in Collections and Collecting, the individual works belonging to families that allow analysis of commonalities and differences.
<br/>
<br/>
I make a painting and then try making a better one.
